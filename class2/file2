Subject:[students] [Imp] Reminder :Project Verfication Form for Internship/Projects
Body: Hello all,

For all the students who are doing some internship or project, Students' 
Placement Office is introducing the Project Verification Form(PVF) for 
all the students , irrespective of the year in which student currently 
is and whether the internship is through SPO or not. This is done in 
order to verify the Internships/Sponsored Research 
Projects/Patents/Publications of students sitting for placements or 
internships. As you might know resumes are subject to verification by 
the Placement office during placements.

*For all the above things you have to get the form signed by your 
project guide or a relevant authority. You can only mention those points 
in the resume which are mentioned in the PVF.*

Form can be found at the following page: 
http://spo.iitk.ac.in/downloads.php with the heading of Project 
Verification Form (DOC).

Kindly note that this form is not meant for the Term papers and Course 
projects that you do towards your course credits. *This is meant for 
those who are going for internships this year or currently working on 
some sponsored projects or are to publish a research paper in the future.*

For any clarifications please send in your queries at sposecy@iitk.ac.in

Regards,
Students' Placement Office
