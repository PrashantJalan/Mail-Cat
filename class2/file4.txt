Hi all,

We received a good response for Embedded design challenge in terms of
number of teams that registered for the event.

There was an upper limit on the number of teams from each pool, and we
have more than 3 entries from few pools.
So, the teams to participate next, will be decided on the basis of the
abstract submitted. Each team is supposed to submit an abstract containing
the details of the theory/principles used, list of components, price of
the same and a detailed methodology of how you wish to solve the problem
statement.

Those, who fail to make to top 3 can still participate, but Electronics
Club will not provide Arduino. They are advised to make some arrangements
on their own.

The deadline for abstract submission is 09:00 pm, August 24,2013(Saturday).

Be strict with the schedule, else the component distribution will be
delayed or the teams would be liable to rejection.

Cheers,
Electronics Club
