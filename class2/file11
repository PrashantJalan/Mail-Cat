 Job Description &#8211; Intern: 
  
 Internships are intended for students to work with our research or
 development groups for 3-6 months to work on specific research or
 development projects under the guidance of MSR India&#8217;s talented
 researchers and developers. They offer internship opportunities in
 most basic topics in Computer Science including theory, systems,
 programming languages, human-computer interaction and machine
 learning. 
  
 Interns participate in all aspect of research, implementation and
 writing papers, and candidates get a good exposure to life in a
 research lab. 
  
  
  
 MSR Research areas&#8217; overview. 
  
  
  
 The MSR India lab has people working in research areas, as detailed
 below: 
  
 Research Area 
  
  
 Description 
  
 Algorithms and Modeling 
  
  
 Algorithms are central to all computing. The second word in the
 title stresses the fact that the input to an algorithm comes from a
 process modeling a real-world problem into data. The group&#8217;s current
 areas of research include matrix and linear algebra algorithms,
 networks, games and economic models and algorithms, semi-definite
 programming and optimization, massive data problems, and
 approximation algorithms. 
  
 Cryptography and Complexity 
  
  
 Researchers in the area of Cryptography and Complexity investigate
 theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography, computational
 complexity, and related areas of mathematics. Specific interests
 include complexity bounds in arithmetic and Boolean models of
 computation, coding theory, (in)approximability, foundations of
 cryptographic schemes and protocols, protocol composition, security
 aspects of signatures, and mathematical models for privacy. 
  
 Machine Learning and Optimization 
  
  
 Machine Learning algorithms and optimization techniques have become
 central to most applications of computing ranging from search, ads,
 data-mining, data-analytics in large databases, information
 retrieval and extraction, natural language processing including
 machine translation, speech, vision, gaming, user adaptation of
 computing systems, as well as security, privacy, and the broad topic
 of crowd-sourcing. Our goal is to conduct research in theoretical
 and practical aspects of Machine Learning and Optimization 
  
 Mobility, Networks, and Systems 
  
  
 The Mobility, Networks, and Systems (MNS) group conducts research in
 networking and systems. Our work and interests span several areas,
 including Internet-scale systems, distributed systems, network
 protocols, wireless networking, mobile computing, and sensor
 systems. We seek to advance the state of the art in these areas
 through measurement, design, and prototyping of real-world and
 experimental networked systems. We share our work with the research
 community by publishing in the leading research conferences and
 journals, and releasing software prototypes. We also work with
 Microsoft's product groups to transfer research technology where
 appropriate. Finally, we engage with academia through research
 collaborations and service on journal editorial boards, conference
 committees, and student thesis committees. 
  
 Multilingual Systems 
  
  
 The Multilingual Systems Group explores software technologies to
 enable seamless content-creation, storage, search, access, and
 interaction with multiple languages. 
  
 Programming Languages and Tools 
  
  
 Earlier known as the Rigorous Software Engineering Group, the PLATO
 group works on tools, languages and methodologies to dramatically
 increase the productivity of software development. We are interested
 in both analysis tools for existing software, as well as in asking
 questions about how software of the future should be designed. 
  
 Security and Privacy 
  
  
 We work on fundamental as well as practical aspects of security and
 privacy. In the area of security, we work in authorization logics
 and access control models, designing secure systems, and
 cryptographic protocols. In the area of privacy we work on designing
 practical privacy preserving advertisement systems, formally
 defining notions of privacy, as well as in designing algorithms that
 simultaneously provide functional value and guarantee privacy. 
  
 Technology for Emerging Markets 
  
  
 The Technology for Emerging Markets (TEM) group seeks to address the
 needs and aspirations of people in the world's developing
 communities. Our research targets people who are increasingly
 consuming computing technologies and services as well as those for
 whom access to computing remains largely out of reach. TEM is a
 multidisciplinary group engaged in a range of technical and
 social-science research. By combining a variety of backgrounds and
 training, we are able to engage deeply with some of the complex
 problems associated with poverty and scarce resources. Our goal is
 to study, design, build, and evaluate technologies and systems that
 are useful for people living in underserved rural and urban
 communities. 
  
 Vision and Media 
  
  
 Researchers in this area work in a broad set of areas in computer
 vision and visual media. Specific research topics of interest
 include, among others, Object recognition; Machine learning in the
 context of vision; Video sequence analysis, including motion
 estimation, optical flow, tracking, structure from motion, and 3D
 scene reconstruction; Dynamic scene understanding including action
 and pose recognition; Internet-based vision including querying and
 retrieval of visual information, visual search, tagging and
 retrieval of images and video; Tools, systems, and design approaches
 for authoring rich and interactive visual narratives; User
 experience of rich and interactive visual narratives; Digital
 Heritage, etc.
