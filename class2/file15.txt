Dear all,

Takneek is just around the corner and it's time to gear up for the most
anticipated event of Takneek, "The SnT Code". Snt Code expresses the
spirit of the council and Takneek in terms of its set objectives which
will take you through the window of time & space to get you acquanited
with the technical history of IITK & what the future holds for us. It will
engage the audience of multi-expertise as well as newbies to complete the
problem statement & kick off the Takneek campaign with a pounding win.

We also have lots of other surprises up our sleeves!

Date: 24th August
Time: 9:00 PM onwards

So see you all there!
