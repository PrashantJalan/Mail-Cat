Hi everyone!

Have you ever looked up at the sky in amazement and wondered and awed at
it's beauty? Did you ever want to have a closer look at it? Have you ever
looked at amazing telescopes and related equipment and wondered how to use
them?

The astronomy club presents to you the Hall level Telescope handling
sessions! On the 23rd of August, we will be coming to Hall 10,11,
GH-1, and GH Tower to teach you all how to use a telescope and a little
about other basic astronomy. Please do come even if there are clouds.
We'll still get a chance to talk about some basic telescope handling and
astronomy.

If any of you missed out on any of our previous sessions, then feel free
