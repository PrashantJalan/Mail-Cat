Hey!

Its time for the second Science CoffeeHouse (IITK's Science Discussion
Group) meet where anyone who is interested in sharing ideas on any
topic in Science is warmly welcome! If you have wondered about
questions on Physics, Maths, Economics, Chemistry, Robots, Psychology
and .. you name it..  or simply found discussing science fun, we look
forward to meeting you.

Feel free to come and do contact us if you have *any* queries. And you
need not have inhibitions if you have an interest but may not know
enough about it, we're all here to learn and share!

Meet-

 *Venue*: CSE Lounge, CSE building
 (Near Computer Center, ask someone or call, if you don't know the
 venue!)
 *Day*: Monday (26th Aug 2013)

 *Time*: 8:30 p.m.

If you are interested to be made aware of *subsequent meets* do fill in
this form, if you haven't already. (Even if you cannot make it this
time say due to HackU)! Will take but a minute! :
