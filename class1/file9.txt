Hey all,
The hard-fought 4 days of the fresher's inferno has ended. And it was
Mughals who showed their dominance in most of the sports. However, the
event brought in many new faces to the campus who would be representing
Institute's name in future.

The final Points tally is-
Mughals-     78
Mauryans-    61
Rajputs-     54
Marathas-    51
