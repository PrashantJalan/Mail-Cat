Hey all

This is a gentle reminder for you to come to the Card and Board Games Room
tonight. It’s the beginning of a new semester, with so many exciting
things
happening on campus, and so much to look forward to. In the midst of all
the hectic activity on campus, the Card and Board Games Hobby Group
presents you with an opportunity to sit back, relax, and as the name
suggests, play some games! At the same time, you get to meet people from
different halls and different batches in a relaxed and friendly
atmosphere.

The hobby group will meet every week on Monday and Thursday evenings, 8.00
pm onwards, in the Games and Sports Council Room, Ground Floor, New SAC.
We kick off with our first meeting this semester tomorrow, the 8th.
Meetings go on till everyone is willing to leave. The running of this club
is entirely in their members' hands.

No prior knowledge of any game is required. We would like to specially
invite all the Freshers to come over and participate.

Here is a list of the games available in the club:

* Go
* Abalone
* Deal Street
* Scotland Yard
* Othello
* Mastermind
* Chinese Checkers
* Taboo
* Pop Vulture
* Monopoly
* Uno
* Life
* Pictionary
* Battleship
* Any Card game you want!

Moreover, we have a new game being displayed tonight. It's called 'The
Conquest' and has been designed by a few M.Des students of IIT Kanpur.

To summarize:
Venue: Games and Sports Council Room, Ground Floor, New SAC
Date: Thursday, 8th August
Time: 8.00 pm onwards

Be there if you are interested in learning new games, or if you just want
to chill out and have some fun!

Cheerio..:)
