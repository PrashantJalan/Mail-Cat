Body: 

Dear Mohit:

Have you been attending class?
You should have raised these issues in today's class where
they could have been discussed easily.

But it is true also that it is partly my fault (see below) -
so if you have not done so, you can mail the TAs and fix your
results - but do this IMMEDIATELY!

cc: 671A
cc: Ram / Ravi:

I had sent a mail to 671@ with the pages below from sajib dasgupta
that defines how to compute the precision and recall in this
case.

Unfortunately I had not sent this mail to 671A@, so the
3d year students did not get this.

While I think many of them would have gotten this info,
it seems that some of them like Mohit, did not.

Since this was my oversight, we cannot penalize them.
I will suggest the following:

1. If reading their submission indicates they did not know
the norms, you may allow them some extra time to update their results,
say till about noon
tomorrow.  If they have evaluated the precision and
recall as per the dasgupta formula, there is no need.

2. I leave the final decision on this matter to the two of you.

AM
