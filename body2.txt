Subject:Course Notes
Body: Dear students:

As mentioned last week in the lecture, I would like to have
all lectures being transcribed, along with as much additional
information as possible. Additional information could be
pictures (with credits, of course), more information (again
with credits, if being reproduced verbatim from some source),
links to videos, simulations, animations, and so on.

As we also said, if someone (or a group of 2) does a good
job at this, one may get up to 3 percent of the course credit,
which will ensure that if you are a borderline case, you will
get the higher grade(and many students miss the higher grade
by up to 3 percent).

If you wish to transcribe a lecture, you may send your name
to one of the two TAs, whose names and email addresses
I just sent in the earlier mail.

Best wishes,

-dheeraj

Subject:TAs for the course
Body: I am happy to announce that the following two students of CSE
department will be the TAs in this course:

Pankaj More (pankajm@iitk.ac.in)
Era Jain (era@iitk.ac.in)

I am particularly happy about them being TAssince they did
a course on Advanced Networking in the previous semester,
and were the top two students in the course.

If you have any questions, problems with any component of
the course, feel free to contact them. Not only their
technical knowledge is very good, they also explain
things very well. We have been very fortunate to have
such TAs.

Best wishes,

-dheeraj
