Hi All,
PFA the Mess Bill for the month of July. We have tried to make sure that
all the problems regarding the Bill which we received have been resolved.
In case the problems still haven't been solved, please mail the Mess
Secretaries with a detailed description of the problem.

NOTE-Please pay the Mess Bill by 8 PM, 23rd August to prevent penalty.

Regards,
Abhishek Tyagi
